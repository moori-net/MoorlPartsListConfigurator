**Simple. Intuitive. Error-free.**

With the **Parts List (BOM) Configurator**, you can create complex product configurations - without any programming and without the risk of incorrect orders.

## What does the Parts List (BOM) Configurator do?

The BOM Configurator allows you to create an intelligent product configurator within the Shopware 6 admin. It combines **multiple variations, properties, and product groups** into a single configuration.

This creates a dynamic filter that shows your customers **only compatible products**, based on their selections (e.g., color, height, material, or performance).

## Intelligent logic - perfect combinations

Once the customer selects certain variations, the system automatically filters out all incompatible products.

The result:

- No incorrect combinations
- No complaints due to incompatible items
- A seamless, user-friendly purchase process

The customer simply selects the desired quantity of each suggested product - the configurator ensures that all chosen items fit together perfectly.

## Automatic bill of materials calculation

A special highlight of the plugin:  
You can use any configuration to **automatically calculate the correct products and their required quantities**.
